/**
 * @title Silver Token (SILVER)
 * @notice ERC-20 token mintable only by the SilverStrike game contract.
 *
 * Audit fixes applied:
 *   L-01  Zero-address guards added to mint() and _transfer().
 *   L-05  OwnerSet event emitted in constructor so deployer is auditable on-chain.
 *   L-07  Two-step ownership transfer: transferOwnership() nominates, acceptOwnership()
 *         confirms. Prevents accidental permanent lockout.
 *   M-05  updateMinter() added as an emergency owner-only path to replace a
 *         compromised or buggy minter. The original one-shot setMinter() is kept
 *         for initial deployment wiring.
 *   I-01  Deployer SHOULD be a multisig (e.g. Gnosis Safe): owner controls both
 *         minter assignment and ownership transfer.
 *   M-03  MAX_SUPPLY cap (100,940,000) is now enforced inside mint() so that any
 *         future minter — including one installed via updateMinter() — cannot
 *         mint beyond the intended hard cap regardless of its own internal logic.
 *   P-01  Emergency pause added. Owner can call pause() to halt mint() and all
 *         token transfers instantly. unpause() resumes normal operation.
 *         Scope is intentionally broad: pausing the token is the last-resort
 *         lever when the minter contract itself cannot be halted in time.
 *   H-1   approve() is now also pause-gated. Without this a malicious actor
 *         could pre-stage allowances during a pause and drain them the moment
 *         the contract is unpaused. The fix makes the pause surface consistent:
 *         mint, transfer, transferFrom, and approve all revert while paused.
