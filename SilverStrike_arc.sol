/**
 * @title SilverStrike
 * @notice On-chain idle clicker game on Arc Testnet (LitVM) — Litecoin's first EVM rollup.
 *
 * Audit fixes applied:
 *   M-03  _checkUpgrade() no longer emits Upgraded; upgrade() emits it once
 *         after confirming a transition occurred. mine() calls _checkUpgrade
 *         and then emits Upgraded itself if the tool changed — one event per
 *         transition, no duplicates.
 *   M-04  LeaderboardEvicted event emitted when a player is displaced from
 *         the last leaderboard slot.
 *   H-03  Constructor rejects address(0) for the token argument so an accidental
 *         zero-address deployment is caught at deploy time rather than silently
 *         bricking the contract.
 *   H-04  Simple reentrancy guard (nonReentrant modifier) added to mine() so
 *         that any future wrapper or token hook cannot re-enter the leaderboard
 *         update while state is mid-write.
 *   L-06  mine() reverts with "Nothing left to mine" when effectiveYield would
 *         be zero, saving the caller wasted gas and keeping event logs clean.
 *   M-06  MAX_LB is treated as an invariant: documented here and enforced by
 *         the fixed-size leaderboard array management. Any increase to MAX_LB
 *         should be accompanied by gas profiling of _updateLeaderboard.
 *   C-01  _checkUpgrade() and the Upgraded event are now emitted AFTER
 *         m.totalMined is updated, so upgrade thresholds are evaluated against
 *         the post-yield balance. Previously the upgrade check fired before
 *         totalMined was incremented, causing the Upgraded event to reference
 *         stale state and confusing indexers.
 *   H-01  Strict CEI order restored in mine(): all state writes (totalMined,
 *         totalMinted, clicks, leaderboard) complete before the external
 *         token.mint() call, eliminating a cross-contract state-observation
 *         window even though nonReentrant already prevents re-entry into mine().
 *   L-03  onLeaderboard mapping added alongside the leaderboard array so that
 *         isOnLeaderboard() is O(1) rather than O(n). The array scan inside
 *         _updateLeaderboard is retained (necessary for position lookup) but
 *         all external callers (SilverBadge) now use the mapping.
 *   M-01  Tie-breaking behaviour documented: players with equal totalMined to
 *         the current last-place holder do not displace them (strict less-than
 *         comparison). This is a deliberate first-mover advantage rule.
 *   I-01  owner field removed — it was set but never read and implied admin
 *         powers that do not exist. If admin functions are added in a future
 *         version they should use the two-step pattern from Silver.
 *   P-01  Emergency pause added. A dedicated owner (set in constructor, two-step
 *         transfer) can call pause() to halt mine() and upgrade() instantly.
 *         unpause() resumes play. Owner is stored separately from Silver's owner
 *         so each contract can be paused independently during an incident.
